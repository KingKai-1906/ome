**Oblivion Modding Essentials** (OME) is a streamlined and compatible approach, intended to be the base of your own Oblivion modlist!

Shipped with the essential mods, requirements and tools needed for building an up-to-date modding list!

It also doubles as a fixed vanilla game, if you want to play it as is!

## System Requirements

Jokes aside, the requirements are the same of the base game, so unless your rig is ancient old, you should be fine!

## Modlist Contents

You can check all mods and plugins at [Load Order Library](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/oblivion-modding-essentials-ome)

## Installation

Installing OME is fairly easy and, if you have Nexus Premium, the process will be 100% automatic.

OME ***REQUIRES*** the **Oblivion Game of the Year Deluxe** version, either on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/900883/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition_Deluxe/) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion_game_of_the_year_edition_deluxe_the)

If you are updating the modlist, skip to the [updating section](#updating).

### Pre-Installation

Prior to installing OME, please complete the following steps.

1. Ensure Oblivion is installed into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location. If you only have one drive, look into LostDragonist's [SteamLibrary tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide).
2. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
3. Remove/Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot. These **will** mess with the installation and, in the case of the latter, causes more problems than it solves.

### Wabbajack Installation

#### Installing Wabbajack

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

#### Downloading and Installing OME

Downloading and installing OME shouldn't take much time, but of course depends on your internet connection and computer. To install OME, complete the following steps:

1. Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists. Check the tickbox that says `Show Unofficial Lists`.
2. Select **Oblivion** at the game dropdown menu.

3. Press the download button on OME and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\OME. **Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.**
5. The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster.
6. Press the play button to begin.
7. Go grab a piece of cheese to offer as tribute to Lord Sheogorath and THE WABBAJACK!
8. Just kidding, you can eat the cheese.
9. If the installation is successful, proceed to [post installation](#post-installation). Otherwise, ask for support on the discord server linked above.

## Post-Installation

### DXVK and FPS Cap info

- OME uses [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/), which changes the graphics renderer from DirectX 9 to Vulkan.

  You can disable DXVK by unticking the mod on MO2 if you want to play using DX9.
  
- Oblivion doesn't like high FPS, so to avoid issues, cap your FPS to 72 at most!

If you have issues/questions and/or just wanna know more about DXVK and FPS capping on Oblivion, check [this guide](https://performance.moddinglinked.com/oblivion.html#RecommendedLimiters).

### Starting up the list

Open the installation folder and double click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. 

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `Oblivion` and press the `Run` button.

### Tools

OME comes with 4 tools bundled at the `tools` folder:

#### Runnable via MO2:
- xEdit 4.0.4
- WryeBash 311

#### Runnable OUTSIDE MO2
- Oblivion Ram Optimizer (a.k.a.: 4GB Patch)
- BSArchPro

## Updating the modlist

Before updating, please check the changelog and back up your saves. You may need to start a new game after certain updates.

Updating is like installing the list. Simply make sure your paths are the same and tick the `overwrite existing modlist` button.

**Note**: Any mods you have added will be deleted when updating.
